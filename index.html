                            <p>Did you ever stop to think that if Facebook or Twitter make money  through content that you post? And, based on this, Haven't you ever thought that might be a great idea that these social networks  share their profits with you?</p>
                            
                            <p>
                            <p>Users of social networks finally able to own their own content through the new tsu network announced Tuesday, reports The Examiner website. The site pays users to generate content.</p>
                            <p>Tsu concept involves giving users the right to own the content they produce, what differentiates the new network of 'giants' social. "The popular social networking business models have been built to receive revenue from the monetization of user-generated content," explains founder tsu, Sebastian Sobczak.</p>
                            
                            <p>"Why should someone commercially benefit from someone else's work without paying the content owner? With tsu users can receive appropriate by the content they produce offsets," said Sobczak.</p>
                            
                            <p>This year the founders, who have raised $ 7 million users to pay for content, expect that apart from individuals, brands and non-profit organizations benefit from economic tsu algorithm.</p>
                            
                            <p>The team cooperates with tsu and charities, athletes, artists, musicians, photographers and users of social networks that support the idea of evaluating the content.</p>
                            <p>The network works based on invitations only grows rapidly, while thousands of users have already registered tsu. "We've reinvented the social network by creating a productive space for everyone and making each user owns a part of the network. So the world should work," Sobczak said.</p>
